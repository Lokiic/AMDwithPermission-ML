# AMDwithPermission-ML
Andoird Malware Detection with different numbers of permissions using machine learning  
Try to detect Android Malware with permissions only  
With Machine Learning  

### 3 folders with different numbers of permissions  

1. 88 permissions  
2. dangerous pid for 34 permissions  
3. sigpid for 22 permissions  

### packages needed:

1. androguard
2. numpy
3. pandas
4. scikit-learn

### usage:

1. toxxpid.py for extract xx permissions from orignal permission csv
2. all.py for training with train.csv and test.csv
3. apkPredict.py for predict apks in dir using model file generated by all.py
4. other py for merge permissions

### others:

models and dataset too big so they get compressed
of course u can train ur own model 
dataset need to be merged by .py
